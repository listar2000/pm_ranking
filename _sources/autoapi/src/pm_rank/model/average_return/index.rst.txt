.. py:module:: src.pm_rank.model.average_return

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Average Return Model for Prediction Market Ranking.

   This module implements ranking algorithms based on the average returns that forecasters
   can achieve from prediction markets. The model calculates expected earnings based on
   different risk aversion profiles and market odds.

   Note: The forecast problem needs to have the field `odds` in order to use this
   model for evaluation.

   IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS:

   - `implied_probs`: The implied probabilities calculated from the market odds across
     all functions below. In our setting, a $p_i$ implied prob for the outcome $i$ signifies
     that a buy contract will cost $p_i$ dollars and pay out 1 dollar if the outcome is $i$.

   - `number of bets`: The number of contracts (see above) to buy for each outcome.

.. py:class:: AverageReturn(num_money_per_round: int = 1, risk_aversion: float = 0.0, verbose: bool = False)

   Average Return Model for ranking forecasters based on their expected market returns.

   This class implements a ranking algorithm that evaluates forecasters based on how much
   money they could earn from prediction markets using different risk aversion strategies.
   The model calculates expected returns for each forecaster and ranks them accordingly.

   Initialize the AverageReturn model.

   :param num_money_per_round: Amount of money to bet per round (default: 1).
   :param risk_aversion: Risk aversion parameter between 0 and 1 (default: 0.0).
   :param verbose: Whether to enable verbose logging (default: False).

   :raises AssertionError: If risk_aversion is not between 0 and 1.

   .. py:method:: fit(problems: List[pm_rank.data.base.ForecastProblem], include_scores: bool = True) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, int]] | Dict[str, int]

      Fit the average return model to the given problems.

      This method processes all problems at once and returns the final rankings
      based on average returns across all problems.

      :param problems: List of ForecastProblem instances to process.
      :param include_scores: Whether to include scores in the results (default: True).

      :returns: Ranking results, either as a tuple of (scores, rankings) or just rankings.



   .. py:method:: fit_stream(problem_iter: Iterator[List[pm_rank.data.base.ForecastProblem]], include_scores: bool = True) -> Dict[int, Tuple[Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, int]] | Dict[str, int]]

      Fit the model to streaming problems and return incremental results.

      This method processes problems as they arrive and returns rankings after each batch,
      allowing for incremental analysis of forecaster performance.

      :param problem_iter: Iterator over batches of ForecastProblem instances.
      :param include_scores: Whether to include scores in the results (default: True).

      :returns: Mapping of batch indices to ranking results.



   .. py:method:: fit_stream_with_timestamp(problem_time_iter: Iterator[Tuple[str, List[pm_rank.data.base.ForecastProblem]]], include_scores: bool = True) -> collections.OrderedDict

      Fit the model to streaming problems with timestamps and return incremental results.

      This method processes problems with associated timestamps and returns rankings
      after each batch, maintaining chronological order.

      :param problem_time_iter: Iterator over (timestamp, problems) tuples.
      :param include_scores: Whether to include scores in the results (default: True).

      :returns: Chronologically ordered mapping of timestamps to ranking results.
